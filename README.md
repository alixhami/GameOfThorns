### About
Game of Thorns is a Bachelorette-themed VR game created for my Ada Developers Academy capstone project. A virtual reality reality television experience, if you will...

### Starting a Game
Locate the three date cards sitting on top atop greek columns. Each card represents a different game that can be played. Touch one of the cards with your controller or a rose to choose the game. A screen with instructions for the game will then appear. To start the game, throw a rose through the instructions screen. See below for a description of each game.

### Timed Limo Arrivals
At the beginning of the game, a limo drives up and bachelors begin to emerge and walk toward the player. The goal of this game is to give roses to the good guys and slap the villains. Using the controller's trigger, the player can spawn beers from one controller and roses from the other. These items can be thrown by holding down the trigger and releasing while performing a throwing motion with the controller. Villains become drunk when a beer is thrown at their head or chest. When good guys are given beers, they appear refreshed but otherwise unaffected. If the player does not give a villain a rose, he will still sneak into the mansion and count as if he was given a rose. Good guys, however, will only enter the mansion if they are given a rose.

### Survival Limo Arrivals
Survival mode has the same objective as the timed version, but the game lasts as long as the player does not slap a good guy, give a villain a rose, or allow a villain to sneak in. The rate of bachelors exiting the limo starts out slow, but increases along with the number of limos.

### Target Practice
Target practice is a rose ceremony inspired game that involves choosing bachelors based upon their job titles. The goal is to give roses only to those bachelors with serious jobs. The serious job titles were taken from the most frequent Bachelorette contestant job titles. The joke job titles are the most ridiculous job titles I could find from past seasons.
